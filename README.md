### TITANIC Project
This project is about creating a machine learning model on the Titanic dataset. It provides information of passengers on the Titanic, summarized by status, sex, age and survival.

I download Datasets of this post from kaggle.com. In this project, I want to predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not.

But first, I added some errors in train dataset to introduce a few examples of Data Engineering challenges. Then I combined Train and Test Datasets toghether. So the Dataset that I uploaded here is different to the original Dataset on kaggle.

This project progress contains:

1- Data Governance: 
    
    In this step, we checked the data for any errors or invalid values and solved them in different ways depending on the data types. This is a regular task for Data Engineers. 

2- Exploratory Data Analysis and Data preprocessing:

    In this step, we analyzed the data visually which helped us to understand every attribute better. we checked missing values and computed them. we found relations between attributes. We bonded categorical attributes to numeric categories, and also, categorized numerical attributes. Also, we create new attributes based on available attributes. In this process, we used matplotlib and seaborn for visualization. 

3- Machine Learning:

    In this step, we trained 4 machine learning models, tried to optimize hyperparameters, computed accuracy, precision, and f1-score, compared models' results, and chose the best one. then we looked at the attributes' importance and K-fold cross-validation for the chosen model.
