# Titanic Survival Prediction Project

![Titanic](images/titanicillustration.jpg) <!-- Add an image related to your project -->

## Overview

This repository contains my analysis and machine learning model for predicting survival on the Titanic based on passenger data. The project was completed as part of my journey in data science. The analysis covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Folder containing the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks containing the analysis, visualization, and model development.
- `images/`: Images and visualizations used in this README.
- `README.md`: The file you're reading right now.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/karrabi/titanic-project.git`
2. Navigate to the repository: `cd titanic-project`

## Notebooks

1. `notebooks/project_titanic_data_preparation.ipynb`: Data loading, cleaning, and handling missing values. 
2. `notebooks/project_titanic_EDA.ipynb`: Visual exploration of data distribution and relationships.
2. `notebooks/project_titanic_ml.ipynb`: Building and evaluating machine learning models.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
