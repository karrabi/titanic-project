### TITANIC Project
This project is about creating a machine learning model on the Titanic dataset. It provides information of passengers on the Titanic, summarized by status, sex, age and survival.

I download Datasets of this post from kaggle.com. In this project, I want to predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not.

But first, I added some errors in train dataset to introduce a few examples of Data Engineering challenges to you. So the Train Dataset that I uploaded here is different to the original Dataset on kaggle.
